## Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood, which can lead to serious health complications if not properly managed. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients and to assist in the management of the condition through data-driven insights.

Important: This project is designed to provide predictions and insights based on data but does not replace a medical diagnosis. Always consult with a healthcare professional for a definitive diagnosis and personalized medical advice.

## Orchestration

To start the orchestration process for running the MLOps pipeline, use the following command:

```
mage start src/mlops
```
This command initiates the pipeline defined in the src/mlops directory, handling tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Web Service

To build and run the web service that serves the diabetes prediction model:

### Build the Docker Image
```
docker build -t diabetes-prediction-service:v1 .
```
### Run the Docker Container
```
docker run -it --rm -e AWS_PROFILE=mlflow-profile -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws -p 9696:9696 diabetes-prediction-service:v1
```
This command runs the web service in a Docker container, making it accessible on port 9696. The service can be used to send patient data and receive diabetes predictions.

## Monitoring
```
cd src/monitoring && evidently ui
```
To monitor the deployed models using Evidently AI, navigate to the monitoring directory and start the UI:

This command launches the Evidently UI, providing a dashboard for monitoring the modelâ€™s performance over time, ensuring its predictions remain accurate and reliable.

## Installation

### Prerequistes 
    - Prerequisites
    - Python 3.10
    - Pipenv
    - Docker
    - AWS CLI (for managing AWS profiles)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlops-diabetes.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd mlops-diabetes
    ```

3. **Install dependencies using `pipenv`:**

    ```bash
    pipenv install --dev
    ```

4. **Activate the Pipenv shell:**

    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```

5. **Install the project as a module using `setup.py`:**

    ```bash
    pipenv run python setup.py install
    ```

6. **Set up your AWS credentials:**

    ```bash
    aws configure --profile mlflow-profile
    ```
    *Note:* Ensure that your profile is correctly configured in the ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config files.

This setup ensures that your Python paths are correctly handled and that all dependencies are properly managed using `pipenv`.
